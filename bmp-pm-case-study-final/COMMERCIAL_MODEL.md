# COMMERCIAL_MODEL — BookMyPlay

Core facts & preferences:
- School capex requirement: ₹15–20L.
- BMP preferred commercial terms: Minimum 5-year lock-in; 10–15 year leases ideally; rent cap around ₹40k–₹50k/month if lease model chosen.
- Pilot revenue share: School 70% / BMP 30% during pilot.

Deal pathways & simple term-sheet templates:
- Partner & Transfer: 5 year convertible contract; School 70% during contract; conversion to school ownership & BMP commission (10–15%) per booking post-conversion.
- Phased capex + revenue share: BMP funds initial upgrades; revenue share tilts to BMP for recovery period.
- BMP-funded Capex + Lease: BMP's model invests in infrastructure, securing a 10+ year lease with a rent holiday until investment is recovered, then paying the market rate rent.
- Hybrid: Minimum rent + overage revenue share.

Negotiation checklist:
- Financial model (5 & 10 year scenarios)
- 2–3 term-sheet options
- KPIs for conversion (MPPS, slot fill rate, incident rate)
- Legal: maintenance, exclusivity, exit clauses
